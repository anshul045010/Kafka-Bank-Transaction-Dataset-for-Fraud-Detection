### INTRODUCTION
In today's digital age, financial institutions are faced with the challenge of managing a vast amount of transaction data. This data holds invaluable insights into customer behavior, market trends, and potential risks. This project aims to leverage the power of data analytics to gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior and identify key trends within a set of bank transaction data.
Through exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques, we will investigate various aspects of customer activity, including transaction patterns, channel preferences, spending habits, and demographic characteristics. The insights gained from this analysis will be used to inform business decisions, improve customer experience, enhance fraud detection capabilities, and optimize operational efficiency.
